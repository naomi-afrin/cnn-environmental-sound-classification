# ðŸŽ§ CNN-Based Environmental Sound Classification

This machine learning project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify environmental sounds such as **car horn**, **scream**, **dog bark**, and **other ambient noises**. Audio files are converted into Mel spectrograms and passed through a CNN architecture for training, evaluation, and real-time prediction.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- Convert raw audio into **Mel spectrograms**
- Use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction
- Train the model to classify sound into 4 categories
- Apply **data augmentation**, **dropout**, and **regularization** for generalization
- Save preprocessed datasets and model for reuse and deployment
- Run batch predictions on unseen audio folders

---

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Librosa, NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for training on Drive)
